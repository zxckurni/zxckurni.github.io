<h2>How to Generate Passive Income with Articles</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Are you new to writing articles online for pay? If you are, you may love the projects that you receive and the upfront payments that you get for those projects. Yes, writing articles for upfront payments is nice, but did you know that you can also use articles as a way to generate passive income?<br />
<br />
If you weren't already aware, passive income is occasionally referred to as the gift that just keeps on giving. Why? Because you earn money over an extend period of time. When writing for upfront payment for a client who is seeking unique content for their website, you typically receive one lump sum payment. Yes, this payment is nice, but how would you like to be earning money on an article that you wrote a year ago?<br />

As for how you can start generating passive income, you have a number of different options. Before reviewing these options, it is important to focus on the word “generating.” Yes, you can earn money overtime, but you may not start seeing huge profits right away. The money will start coming in soon, but it may take a couple of months or more.<br />
<br />
One of the best ways to create passive income with your articles is to create your own specialty website. This website should have a theme that is either a popular subject or one that interests you. For example, do you homeschool your children? If so, you can create a website that shares tips with other homeschooling parents. These tips and other information will be shared through your written articles, which will be displayed on your website. The same will be said for blogs, but readers often require updated content, sometimes on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
As for how you generate passive income through a website or blog, you do so through advertisements. One program that comes highly rated and recommend is Google AdSense. With this program, you generate income each time that a reader clicks on your advertisements. There are also affiliate programs, where retailers give you banners to post on your website, alongside your articles. Each time your website or blog generates a sale, you receive a percentage of that sale.<br />
<br />
If you opt to receive passive income by way of your own niche website or blog, you need to make sure that readers find you. Unfortunately, you may face a lot of competition online. The good news is that you can write more articles to do so. Since article writing is your specialty, this isn't hard. Write unique articles and submit them to online article directories. Be sure to include a link to your website. You may be surprised how many readers follow that link. The more visitors your website or blog receives, the better your changes are for getting your advertisements clicked on.<br />
<br />
Although creating your own content filled website is one of the best ways to generate passive income, as you are in control at all times, there is an easier approach. That approach involves finding revenue sharing websites. These are content filled websites, but they rely on professional writers to compose it. In exchange, you may receive a percentage of the revenue generated from your articles or you may receive an already agreed upon bonus. If you cannot afford the cost of web-hosting, which is needed to start your own website, this is a great approach.<br />
<br />
As for how you can find these revenue sharing websites, perform a standard internet search online. Also, many online communities are devoted to writing articles online. If you are not already a member, join. Members of these communities often share money making opportunities they came across online, revenue sharing websites included. <br />
<br />
As stated above, passive income can be generated a number of different ways. With that said, if you rely on article writing to make a living, it may be best to spice up your writing. Find upfront paying clients or paid submission websites online and work on generating passive income in your spare time. In all honesty, you cannot go wrong with this approach.</div>
